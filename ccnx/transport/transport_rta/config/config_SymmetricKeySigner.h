 * @file config_SymmetricKeySigner.h
 * @brief Generates stack and connection configuration information
 *
 * Each component in the protocol stack must have a configuration element.
 * This module generates the configuration elements for the Symmetric Keystore.
 * The keystore is specific to a Connection, so there is no Protocol Stack configuration.
 *
 * @code
 * {
 *      // Configure a stack with {APIConnector,TLVCodec,MetisConnector}
 *      // The coded will use a symmetric keystore
 *
 *      stackConfig = ccnxStackConfig_Create();
 *      connConfig = ccnxConnectionConfig_Create();
 *
 *      apiConnector_ProtocolStackConfig(stackConfig);
 *      apiConnector_ConnectionConfig(connConfig);
 *      tlvCodec_ProtocolStackConfig(stackConfig);
 *      tlvCodec_ConnectionConfig(connConfig);
 *      symmetricKeySigner_ConnectionConfig(connConfig, "~/.ccnx/keystore.p12", "foobar password");
 *
 *      metisForwarder_ProtocolStackConfig(stackConfig);
 *      metisForwarder_ConnectionConfig(connConfig, metis_port);
 *
 *      CCNxTransportConfig *config = ccnxTransportConfig_Create(stackConfig, connConfig);
 * }
