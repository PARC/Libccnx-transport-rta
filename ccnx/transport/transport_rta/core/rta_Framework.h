/**
 * @file rta_Framework.h
 * @brief <#Brief Description#>
 *
 * rtaFramework executes inside the worker thread in callback from the event scheduler.
 *
 * It provides service functions to components and connectors so they do not need
 * to be event aware.
 *
 * It also manages the command channel to communicate with rtaTransport in the API's thread.
 *
 * _Create(), _Start(), and _Destroy() are called from the API's thread.  You should not
 * call _Destroy until rtaFramework_GetStatus() is FRAMEWORK_SHUTDOWN.
 *
 * The framework can run in threaded mode or non-threaded mode.  Including this one
 * header gives you both sets of operations, but they are not compatible.
 *
 * THREADED MODE:
 *      call _Create
 *      call _Start
 *      ... do work ...
 *      call _Shutdown
 *      call _Destroy
 *
 * NON-THREADED MODE
 *      call _Create
 *      ... do work ...
 *      call _Step or _StepCount or _StepTimed
 *      ... do work ...
 *      call _Step or _StepCount or _StepTimed
 *      ... do work ...
 *      call _Teardown
 *      call _Destroy
