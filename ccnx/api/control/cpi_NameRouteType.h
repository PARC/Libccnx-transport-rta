/**
 * @file cpi_NameRouteType.h
 * @brief Specifies how a route should be matched
 *
 * NOTE: Only LONGEST_MATCH is currently implemented.
 *
 * A LONGEST_MATCH route is a normal CCNx route entry.  It will match any Interest name that is equal to the route prefix
 * or any Interest name that is equal to the router prefix and has additional name components.  Each name component must be
 * exactly equal on a component-by-component basis.
 *
 * An EXACT_MATCH route will not match any longer names.  An Interest name must exactly match the route prefix.
 *
 * A Default route will be used if there are no other matches.
