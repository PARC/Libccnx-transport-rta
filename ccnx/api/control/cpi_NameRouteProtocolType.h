/**
 * @file cpi_NameRouteProtocolType.h
 * @brief Specifies the reason for or creator of a route (i.e. the protocol that created the route)
 *
 * A LOCAL route points to an application running on the localhost.
 *
 * A CONNECTED route exists because the described destination is directly connected to the localhost.  For
 * example, a route to a link local network name would be CONNECTED.
 *
 * A STATIC route is administratively created, such as via the "metis_control" program or via the
 * configuration file.
 *
 * An ACORN route is dynamically created by the ACRON routing protocol.
