 *
 * The following equivalence relations on non-null `CPIConnectionList` instances are maintained:
 *
 *  * It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, `CPIConnectionList_Equals(x, x)`
 *      must return true.
 *
 *  * It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values x and y,
 *    `cpiConnectionList_Equals(x, y)` must return true if and only if
 *        `cpiConnectionList_Equals(y, x)` returns true.
 *
 *  * It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if
 *        `cpiConnectionList_Equals(x, y)` returns true and
 *        `cpiConnectionList_Equals(y, z)` returns true,
 *        then  `cpiConnectionList_Equals(x, z)` must return true.
 *
 *  * It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple
 *      invocations of `cpiConnectionList_Equals(x, y)` consistently return true or
 *      consistently return false.
 *
 *  * For any non-null reference value x, `cpiConnectionList_Equals(x, NULL)` must
 *      return false.
 *
 * @param a A pointer to a `CPIConnectionList` instance.
 * @param b A pointer to a `CPIConnectionList` instance.
 * @return true if the two `CPIConnectionList` instances are equal.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * {
 *    CPIConnectionList *a = cpiConnectionList_Create();
 *    CPIConnectionList *b = cpiConnectionList_Create();
 *
 *    if (cpiConnectionList_Equals(a, b)) {
