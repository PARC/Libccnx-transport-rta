/**
 * @file cpi_ControlFacade.h
 * @ingroup Utility
 * @brief <#Brief Description#>
 *
 * A ControlFacade has several flavors.  A Notification is a spontaneous message
 * sent as an indication of some state or condition.  A CPI (ControlPlaneInterface)
 * message is a Request/Reponse protocol used to manage the Transport.
 *
 * The ccnxControlFacade takes ownership of the JSON object
 * and will destroy it when it's Destroy is called.
 *
 * If put inside a CCNxMetaMessage and sent to the Transport, the Transport
 * takes ownership of the CCNxMetaMessage and will thus be responsible for
 * destroying the object.
